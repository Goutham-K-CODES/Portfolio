This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file.

To add your actual resume:
1. Copy your "K.Goutham resume.pdf" file to this public folder
2. Rename it to "resume.pdf" (or update the Hero component to match your filename)
3. The download button will then work correctly

The current setup in Hero.tsx expects the file at /resume.pdf and will download it as "Goutham_Resume.pdf"
